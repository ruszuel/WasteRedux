            Plastic has revolutionized our lives but poses significant problems. It persists in the environment for decades, if not centuries, 
            with every plastic item ever used still on Earthâ€”either as it was, recycled, or broken down into microplastics. Despite its utility, 
            plastic waste is overwhelming and problematic, with estimates suggesting it can last for hundreds of years.
